  🌎 Netlify GeoIP redirect 🌍
</h1>

This is a proof of concept of GeoIP using **Netlify’s** `redirect & rewrite` 
rules using country codes (us, gb, br, pt) to route the response of the GET 
call to a specific language using the **i18next** structure.


You can see more on the [netlify.toml](https://github.com/valtermartins1301/poc-geoip-redirect/blob/master/netlify.toml) file.
